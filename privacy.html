            <p>We may use Service Providers partly located in so-called third
                countries (outside the European Union or the European Economic Area or
                Switzerland) or process personal data there, i.e., countries whose level
                of data protection does not correspond to that of the EU or
                Switzerland.</p>
            <p>We safeguard your personal data per our contractual obligations and
                applicable data protection legislation when transferring data
                abroad.</p>
            <p>Such safeguards may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The transfer to countries that have been deemed to provide an
                    adequate level of protection according to the Federal Council, as well
                    as to countries where there is an adequacy decisions by the European
                    Commission in place</li>
                <li>Applying standard data protection model clauses, binding corporate
                    rules or other standard contractual obligations that provide appropriate
                    data protection</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If a third country transfer takes place and there is no adequacy
                decision or appropriate safeguards, it is possible and there is a risk
                that authorities in the third country (e.g. intelligence services) can
                gain access to the transferred data and that the enforceability of your
                data subject’s rights cannot be guaranteed.</p>
            <h3 id="data-disclosure">7. Data disclosure</h3>
            <p>We may disclose your personal data in the good faith belief that such
                action is necessary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To comply with a legal obligation (i.e., if required by law or in
                    response to valid requests by public authorities, such as a court or
                    government agency)</li>
                <li>To protect the security of our Services and defend our rights or
                    property</li>
                <li>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with
                    us</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="data-on-the-blockchain">8. Data on the blockchain</h3>
            <p>When using our Services or using any applicable blockchain in
                relationship with our Services, you should be aware that any
                transactions will be publicly and irrevocably archived on the applicable
                blockchain once you sign them and send them to the network. These
                transactions typically include information about how many tokens have
                been bought, sold, transferred or otherwise interacted with, a
                timestamp, and the involved addresses. They do not include data such as
                your name or e-mail address. Nonetheless, once someone knows that a
                particular address belongs to you, they can connect all the transactions
                involving that address to you.</p>
            <h3 id="data-security">9. Data security</h3>
            <p>We take reasonable technical and organisational security measures
                that we deem appropriate to protect your stored data against
                manipulation, loss, or unauthorised third-party access. Our security
                measures are continually adapted to technological developments.</p>
            <p>We also take internal data privacy very seriously. Our employees and
                the service providers that we engage are required to maintain secrecy
                and comply with applicable data protection legislation. In addition,
                they are granted access to personal data only insofar as this is
                necessary for them to carry out their respective tasks or mandate.</p>
            <p>The security of your personal data is important to us but remember
                that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage
                is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
                protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                We recommend using antivirus software, a firewall, and other similar
                software to safeguard your system.</p>
            <h3 id="your-rights">10. Your rights</h3>
            <p>You have the below data protection rights. To exercise these rights,
                you may contact the above address or send an e-mail to:
                privacy@lexr.com. Please note that we may ask you to verify your
                identity before responding to such requests.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right of access</strong>: You have a right to request a copy
                    of your personal data, which we will provide to you in an electronic
                    form.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to amendment</strong>: You have the right to ask us to
                    correct our records if you believe they contain incorrect or incomplete
                    information about you.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent: If you have provided your consent
                    to the processing of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw
                    your consent at any time with effect for the future. This includes cases
                    where you wish to opt-out from marketing communications. Once we have
                    received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no
                    longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you
                    initially consented to unless there is another legal basis for
                    processing.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Right to erasure</strong>: You have the right to request
                    that we delete your personal data when it is no longer necessary for the
                    purposes for which it was collected or when it was unlawfully
                    processed.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong>: You have the
                    right to request the restriction of our processing of your personal data
                    where you believe it to be inaccurate, our processing is unlawful, or
                    where we no longer need to process it for the initial purpose, but where
                    we are not able to delete it due to a legal obligation or because you do
                    not want us to delete it.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to portability</strong>: You have the right to request
                    that we transmit your personal data to another data controller in a
                    standard format such as Excel, if this is data which you have provided
                    to us and if we are processing it on the legal basis of your consent or
                    to perform our contractual obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to object to processing: Where the legal basis for our
                    processing of your personal data is our legitimate interest, you have
                    the right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your
                    particular situation. We will abide by your request unless we have a
                    compelling legal basis for the processing which overrides your interests
                    or if we need to continue to process the personal data for the exercise
                    or defence of a legal claim.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
                    authority</strong>: You have the right of appeal to a data protection
                    supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your
                    personal data violates data protection law. The competent data
                    protection authority in Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and
                    Information Commissioner (www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html). In the
                    EU and EEA, you can exercise this right, for example, before a
                    supervisory authority in the Member State of your residence, your place
                    of work or the place of the alleged infringement. You can find a list of
                    the relevant authorities here:

                Social media and links to third-party apps and websites</h3>
            <p>Our Services contain links to websites or apps that are not operated
                by us. When you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to
                that third party’s website or app. We have no control over the content,

                services.</p>
            <p>We maintain online presences on social networks to, among other
                things, communicate with customers and prospective customers and to
                provide information about our products and Services. If you have an
                account on the same network, it is possible that your information and
                media made available there may be seen by us, for example, when we
                access your profile. In addition, the social network may allow us to
                contact you. As soon as we transfer personal data into our own system,
                we are responsible for this independently. This is then done to carry
                out pre-contractual measures and to fulfil a contract. For the legal
                basis of the data processing carried out by the social networks under
                their own responsibility, please refer to their data protection
                declarations. Below is a list of social networks on which we operate an
